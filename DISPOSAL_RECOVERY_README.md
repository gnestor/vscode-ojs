# Webview Disposal Recovery Fixes - Enhanced Version

## Problem Description

The HTML preview webview had persistent issues with reopening after being disposed multiple times. Users reported "is disposed" errors and the inability to reopen the preview reliably after several close/open cycles.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **VS Code Internal Disposal State**: VS Code WebviewPanel has internal disposal mechanisms that aren't directly accessible
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple async operations could reference disposed panels
3. **Incomplete State Detection**: Our disposal flag wasn't comprehensive enough
4. **Missing Error Recovery**: No graceful recovery when disposal errors occurred
5. **Unsafe Panel Operations**: Operations on potentially disposed panels without validation

## Enhanced Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Panel Usability Check

```typescript
private isPanelUsable(): boolean {
    if (this._isDisposed) {
        return false;
    }

    try {
        // Multiple checks to ensure the panel is really usable
        // 1. Check if webview exists
        const webview = this._panel.webview;
        
        // 2. Try to access webview properties
        const _ = webview.html;
        
        // 3. Check if we can set properties (this will fail if disposed)
        const currentTitle = this._panel.title;
        this._panel.title = currentTitle;
        
        return true;
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Panel is no longer usable:', error);
        this._isDisposed = true;
        if (HtmlPreview.currentPanel === this) {
            HtmlPreview.currentPanel = undefined;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This method performs multiple validation checks that will throw errors if the panel is disposed by VS Code.

### 2. Safe Static Panel Validation

```typescript
static hasUsablePanel(): boolean {
    if (!HtmlPreview.currentPanel) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (!HtmlPreview.currentPanel.isPanelUsable()) {
        HtmlPreview.currentPanel = undefined;
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

Provides a safe way to check if a panel exists and is usable before attempting operations.

### 3. Defensive Programming in All Methods

All methods that interact with the webview now use the `isPanelUsable()` check:

- `updateContent()`: Validates panel before updating HTML
- `switchToDocument()`: Checks usability before switching documents  
- `debounceUpdate()`: Validates panel before and after timeout
- `updateTranspilerOptions()`: Ensures panel is usable before applying options

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

```typescript
try {
    // Webview operations
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating webview content:', error);
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
    if (errorMessage.includes('disposed')) {
        console.log('Panel was disposed, cleaning up...');
        this._isDisposed = true;
        if (HtmlPreview.currentPanel === this) {
            HtmlPreview.currentPanel = undefined;
        }
    }
}
```

All webview operations are now wrapped in try-catch blocks that detect disposal errors and clean up appropriately.

### 5. Improved createOrShow Logic

```typescript
static async createOrShow(ctx: vscode.ExtensionContext, textDocument: vscode.TextDocument) {
    // Use the safe check for existing panel
    if (HtmlPreview.hasUsablePanel()) {
        try {
            // Safe operations on validated panel
            HtmlPreview.currentPanel!.switchToDocument(textDocument);
            HtmlPreview.currentPanel!._panel.reveal();
            return;
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('Error using existing panel, creating new one:', error);
            HtmlPreview.currentPanel = undefined;
        }
    }
    
    // Create new panel if none exists or previous was unusable
    // ... panel creation code
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Files

1. **`test-disposal-recovery.html`**: Basic disposal recovery test
2. **`advanced-disposal-test.html`**: Comprehensive test with multiple scenarios

### Test Protocol

1. **Rapid Cycling Test**: Open/close preview 10+ times rapidly
2. **Long Duration Test**: Keep preview open for extended periods, then close/reopen
3. **Multi-Document Test**: Switch between different HTML files
4. **Error Injection Test**: Trigger errors and verify recovery
5. **Memory Leak Test**: Monitor memory usage during repeated cycles

### Success Criteria

- ✅ No "is disposed" errors in console
- ✅ Preview opens successfully after any number of disposals  
- ✅ All functionality works after recovery
- ✅ No memory leaks or performance degradation
- ✅ Graceful error handling and recovery

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Proactive Disposal Detection
Instead of waiting for errors, we actively validate panel state before operations.

### 2. Multiple Validation Layers
- Internal `_isDisposed` flag
- WebView property access validation
- Title property modification test
- HTML property access validation

### 3. Automatic Cleanup
When disposal is detected, the system automatically:
- Marks the instance as disposed
- Clears the static reference
- Logs the detection for debugging
- Prevents further operations

### 4. Error Recovery
The system can recover from disposal errors by:
- Detecting disposal in error messages
- Cleaning up stale references
- Creating new panels when needed
- Maintaining user workflow continuity

## Files Modified

- `src/notebook-kit/htmlPreview.ts`: Complete disposal handling overhaul
- `test-disposal-recovery.html`: Basic test file
- `advanced-disposal-test.html`: Comprehensive test suite

## Debugging Features

### Console Logging
- Panel creation/disposal events
- Disposal detection messages
- Error recovery actions
- Usability check results

### Test Utilities
- Load counters for tracking disposal cycles
- Memory usage monitoring (where available)
- Interactive test buttons
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Telemetry**: Track disposal/recovery events for analytics
2. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic preview reopening after unexpected disposal
3. **State Persistence**: Save and restore panel state across sessions
4. **Multiple Panels**: Support for concurrent preview panels
5. **Health Monitoring**: Periodic panel health checks

## Compatibility

These changes are fully backward compatible and don't affect the existing API. The enhancements provide additional robustness while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Validation checks are lightweight property accesses
- **Reduced Memory Leaks**: Better cleanup prevents resource accumulation
- **Improved Stability**: Fewer crashes and errors improve overall performance
- **Faster Recovery**: Quick detection and recovery from disposal states
